Wherein at ease for aye to dwell.
I said, ‘O Soul, make merry and carouse,

A huge crag-platform, smooth as burnish’d brass,
I chose. The ranged ramparts bright
From level meadow-bases of deep grass

'bio':`Unripe harvest there hath none to reap it
From the misty gusty place,
Unripe vineyard there hath none to keep it
In unprofitable space.
Living men and women are not found there,
Only masks in flocks and shoals;

Ever wavering orbs and poles;

Shades of bodies without souls.`,

Just such a retrospect

A Past of Plank and Nail
And slowness – then the scaffolds drop
Affirming it a Soul –`,
